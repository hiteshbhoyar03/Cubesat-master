This Sun Sensor module is designed for fine sun vector detection on a CubeSat using position-sensitive detectors (PSDs). The sensor includes low-noise amplification, real-time processing via an ultra-low-power STM32 microcontroller, and SPI communication to the OBC or EPS.

>  Part of a modular CubeSat system for attitude determination and control (ADCS) experiments and embedded systems learning.

##  Design Highlights

-  High-resolution, dual-axis sun vector sensing
-  Low-noise op-amp signal path
-  Ultra-low-power STM32 MCU for in-orbit efficiency
-  SPI-compatible with other CubeSat systems
-  Tri-state buffer to avoid SPI bus contention
-  Compact design for integration into small stacks

##  Key Features

- **Hamamatsu S5990-01**
  - Dual-axis position-sensitive photodiodes (PSDs)
  - Analog voltage output proportional to light centroid

- **TLV9004Q1**
  - Quad-channel low-offset operational amplifiers
  - Used to amplify and condition the PSD outputs

- **STM32L031**
  - Ultra-low-power ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU
  - Handles sensor data acquisition, conversion, and SPI communication

- **SPI Interface**
  - Communicates with the main CubeSat controller (e.g., OBC)
  - Uses **SN74LVC1G125DBVT** buffer to manage the MISO line (high-impedance when inactive)

- **Connector**
  - Compact Molex connector for external interface to the CubeSat stack (power + SPI)
