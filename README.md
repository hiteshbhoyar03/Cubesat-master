</a>

The brain of the CubeSat, responsible for mission control, data handling, and system coordination. It interfaces with various sensors (IMU, magnetometer, GPS, Sun Sensor) and memory units (MRAM, NOR Flash) to perform autonomous decision-making and telemetry. It also communicates with the EPS and other modules using CAN and UART.

- **Processor**: STM32L496ZGT6 
- **Memory**: MR25H40MDF (MRAM), S25HL512TFANHI010 (NOR Flash)
- **Sensors**: ISM330ISN (IMU), MMC5983MA (Magnetometer)

</a>

The power distribution and management unit of the CubeSat. It regulates and switches multiple power rails (3.3V, 5V, unregulated), monitors solar input and battery status, and ensures safe and efficient power flow throughout the system. It features a dual-MCU architecture for redundancy, MPPT solar charging, temperature monitoring, heater control, and full CAN/UART communication.

- **Main MCU**: STM32L496
- **Standby/Reset MCU**: STM32L452 (SRIC)
- Designed with minimal power usage for deep sleep and wakeup control

##  Sun Sensor Board

<a href="https://github.com/hiteshbhoyar03/Cubesat-master/tree/main/Sun%20Sensor">
<img align="right" width="22%" src="https://github.com/hiteshbhoyar03/Cubesat-master/blob/main/Sun%20Sensor/gallery/sunsensor%20front.png">
</a>

A lightweight attitude reference sensor using dual analog PSDs to measure the direction of sunlight. It processes analog outputs via op-amps and converts them to digital values using an ultra-low-power STM32 MCU. It transmits sun vector data to the OBC over an SPI interface and supports MISO tri-state control for shared bus compatibility.

- **MCU**: STM32L031G6U7
- **PSD Sensors**: 2 × Hamamatsu S5990-01
- **Signal Conditioning**: 2 × TLV9004Q1 (quad op-amps)
- **Interface**: SPI with MISO

##  Project Purpose

An academic and portfolio project to:

- Explore and apply **embedded hardware design** techniques  
- Implement **low‑power and fault‑tolerant architectures**  
- Design **custom PCBs** using **Altium Designer**  
- Interface subsystems via **STM32L496** and **SPI sensors**  
- Demonstrate engineering workflows for CubeSat systems  

This CubeSat project showcases my embedded systems skills through a complete 3-board satellite stack (OBC, EPS, Battery) and a custom Sun Sensor. It focuses on PCB design (Altium) and low-level firmware development using STM32 MCUs, highlighting real-world satellite subsystem integration for learning and demonstration purposes.
